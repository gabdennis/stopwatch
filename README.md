# A Web based Stopwatch

This simple project is a web-based stopwatch application. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds. 

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structure of the stopwatch, including buttons for controlling the timer. 

CSS is used to style the stopwatch, making it visually appealing with a gradient background and styled buttons. 

JavaScript handles the functionality of the stopwatch, updating the timer display every second and managing the start, stop, and reset actions. 

This project is a great example of how to create an interactive web application using basic web technologies.
